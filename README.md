# workDayScheduler
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This page uses Moment.js to get the current date and hour. The current day is displayed neatly at the top of the page. Below, you will find time blocks for each hour from 9am-11pm. The time blocks displayed in grey have already passed, the time block in red is the current hour, and time blocks in green are in the future.

Enter any activities you have planned for the day in the colored portion of the time block and hit the save button to the right to save your plans for that hour! Feel free to exit out of the page when you are done and come back to it later to see what plans you have left for the day. The plans you saved will still be there; however, the color might be different from when you entered it!
